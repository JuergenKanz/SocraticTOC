# SocraticTOC - Socratic Questioning in TOC Thinking Processes

An interactive mind map for thinkers who want to improve their logic.

![SocraticTOC](https://github.com/JuergenKanz/SocraticTOC/blob/main/cover.jpg)

The mind map has been developed with Mindjet MindmanagerÂ® 21 for Windows. The created output is an interactive HTML5 file, which runs on almost all web browsers. So, apart from the SocraticTOC.html file, no extra software is needed.

The attached PDF file "SocraticTOC - Introduction" gives some hints on how to work with the mind map.

Please, enjoy my work.
